# Face-Regocgnition

A Face Recognition project made by using python and opencv.

Train the model by inserting images in the right folders by using the Train_Face_Recog___Identification.py 
and run it by using the Face_Recog___Identification.py file. 

Note: To use external video cameras change from cv2.VideoCapture(0) to cv2.VideoCapture(1) to not get any issues. 

Enjoy
